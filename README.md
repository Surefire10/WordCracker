WordCracker is a Lightweight translator app for Desktops.

<h3>How it Works:</h3>

WordCracker uses a translation API to send a request with the origin text. The API then responds
with the translation which is then displayed. Really simple stuff!


WordCracker is written in Java, with JavaFX for the GUI. 

<h3>How to Install it:</h3>

All you have to do is clone this repository, open it in an IDE and run the file containing the main method.
Just keep in mind that you have to have your own API Key for a translation API,
and make the request as per instructions given by the API provider.
